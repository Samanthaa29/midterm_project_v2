# Ironhack - Midterm project

## üìå REQUIREMENTS

In this project, we will be building a banking system. We should meet all of the requirements below:

1. The system must have 4 types of accounts: StudentChecking, Checking, Savings, and CreditCard.

     - *Checking Accounts* should have:A balance A secretKey A PrimaryOwner An optional SecondaryOwner A minimumBalance A penaltyFee A monthlyMaintenanceFee A creationDate A status (FROZEN, ACTIVE).
     - *Student Checking Accounts* are identical to Checking Accounts except that they do NOT have:A monthlyMaintenanceFee A minimumBalance.
     - *Savings* are identical to Checking accounts except that they Do NOT have a monthlyMaintenanceFee Do have an interestRate CreditCard.
     - *CreditCard Accounts* have:A balance A PrimaryOwner An optional SecondaryOwner A creditLimit An interestRate A penaltyFee.

2. The system must have 3 types of Users: Admins and AccountHolders. AccountHolders
    - The *AccountHolders* should be able to access their own accounts and only their accounts when passing the correct credentials using Basic Auth. 
    - *AccountHolders* have:A name Date of birth A primaryAddress (which should be a separate address class) An optional mailingAddress
    - *Admins* only have a name
    - The *ThirdParty Accounts* have a hashed key and a name.

3. Admins can create new accounts. When creating a new account they can create Checking, Savings, or CreditCard Accounts.

  **SAVINGS ACCOUNTS**
  
   - Savings accounts have a default interest rate of 0.0025.
   - Savings accounts may be instantiated with an interest rate other than the default, with a maximum interest rate of 0.5.
   - Savings accounts should have a default minimumBalance of 1000.
   - Savings accounts may be instantiated with a minimum balance of less than 1000 but no lower than 100 CreditCards
    
  **CREDIT CARD**
  
   - CreditCard accounts have a default creditLimit of 100.
   - CreditCards may be instantiated with a creditLimit higher than 100 but not higher than 100000.
   - CreditCards have a default interestRate of 0.2 
   - CreditCards may be instantiated with an interestRate less than 0.2 but not lower than 0.1
    
  **CHECKING ACCOUNTS**
  
   - When creating a new Checking account, if the primaryOwner is less than 24, a StudentChecking account should be created otherwise a regular Checking Account should be created.
   - Checking accounts should have a minimumBalance of 250 and a monthlyMaintenanceFee of 12

  4. Interest and Fees should be applied appropriately.
  
  **PENALTY FEE**
  
   - The penaltyFee for all accounts should be 40. 
   - If any account drops below the minimumBalance, the penaltyFee should be deducted from the balance automatically InterestRate
    
  **INTEREST RATE**
  
   - Interest on savings accounts is added to the account annually at the rate of specified interestRate per year. That means that if I have 1000000 in a savings account with a 0.01 interest rate, 1% of 1 Million is added to my account after 1 year. When a savings account balance is accessed, you must determine if it has been 1 year or more since either the account was created or since interest was added to the account, and add the appropriate interest to the balance if necessary.
   - Interest on credit cards is added to the balance monthly. If you have a 12% interest rate (0.12) then 1% interest will be added to the account monthly. When the balance of a credit card is accessed, check to determine if it has been 1 month or more since the account was created or since interested was added, and if so, add the appropriate interest to the balance.

  5. Account Access
  
  **ADMINS**
  
   - Admins should be able to access the balance for any account and to modify it.
    
  **ACOUNTHOLDERS**
  
   - AccountHolders should be able to access their own account balance.
   - Account holders should be able to transfer money from any of their accounts to any other account (regardless of owner). The transfer should only be processed if the account has sufficient funds. The user must provide the Primary or Secondary owner name and the id of the account that should receive the transfer. 
    
  **THIRD-PARTY USERS**
  
   - There must be a way for third-party users to receive and send money to other accounts. 
   - Third-party users must be added to the database by an admin. 
   - In order to receive and send money, Third-Party Users must provide their hashed key in the header of the HTTP request. They also must provide the amount, the Account id and the account secret key.

## ‚ùóCLASS DIAGRAM

Before making the project, it is very important to make a class diagram to get a basic idea of the classes needed and the structure of the project.
